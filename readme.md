# Since the twitter API has effectively been shut down, barring large fees and longer application times, I can no longer maintain this tool. Feel free to fork it and maintain a future version. 

## Twitter Archiver

A quick bot that mass saves tweets from an account

Requirements:
Must have tweepy installed (pip install tweepy)
Uses dotenv (pip install dotenv)

This was built to archive the tweets of people who passed away, as twitter may soon be deleting those accounts due to inactivity.

Please only use this tool for good.
